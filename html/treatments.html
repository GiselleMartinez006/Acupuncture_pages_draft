                <p>Only recently is acupuncture being prescribed in the Western world, and still with much reluctance, although the practice is proven to be an effective alternative to many prescription drugs. More and more scientific research is acknowledging
                    that acupuncture is beneficial for the treatment of menstrual and menopausal symptoms, to manage pain, to ease the side effects of chemotherapy and the symptoms of fibromyalgia, to treat migraines, and to strengthen the immune system.
                    <br> </br> In fact, a newer study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, collected data from 18,000 participants who took part in acupuncture studies. Findings showed that acupuncture should be considered a valid treatment
                    for all types of chronic pain (i.e., arthritis, chronic back pain, anxiety, the effects of chemotherapy, and in the treatment of obesity). </p>

                    Medicine concept of “essence” in a future article, but basically it’s enough to understand for now that your day to day energy comes from the food you eat, like a checking account is used for day to day expenses. The essence is more
                    like your savings account, your deeper reserves. When your fire is out of balance it starts to consume your essence and “Inflammation” ensues. Inflammation speeds up aging. Inflammation also invites …. Dampness. It’s part of the natural

            <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Many people often equate the practice of acupuncture with the practice of traditional Chinese medicine. This is not entirely true. While acupuncture is the most often practiced component of traditional Chinese medicine, it is simply that –
                a component, an important piece of a much larger puzzle. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses several methods designed to help patients achieve and maintain health. Along with acupuncture, TCM incorporates adjunctive techniques such
                as cupping, acupressure and moxibustion; manipulative and massage techniques such as tuina and gua sha; herbal medicine; diet and lifestyle changes; meditation; and exercise (often in the form of qigong or tai chi).</a>

                        Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in which thin needles are inserted into the body at specific points of energy channels called meridians.</p>
                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Acupuncture is an ancient form of healthcare that originated in China at least 2,500 years ago. It has been practiced throughout the Asian world for many centuries. Acupuncture has been accepted into the Western mainstream culture
                        since the 1970’s and is currently soaring in popularity throughout many parts of the Western hemisphere. Through the use of extremely fine needles, acupuncture works by manipulating the flow of Qi in the body, which is the life
                        force or energy force that is present in all living things. Acupuncture theory suggests that there are 12 main meridians through which Qi flows. These meridians correspond to the major internal organs of the body. For instance,
                        there is a liver meridian, a heart meridian, and so on. In each of these meridians, the Qi can become stagnant or deficient. StagnantQi means that there is a blockage or excess of energy, which can cause a variety of symptoms including
                        pain, inflammation, headaches, high blood pressure, depression, and menstrual imbalances. Deficient Qi means that there isn’t enough functional energy within a given organ to perform its necessary duties. For instance, chronic
                        diarrhea and fatigue can easily be caused by deficient Qi of the spleen. Acupuncture therapy typically involves inserting needles into several acupoints, which are specific locations on the meridians where Qi is said to gather.
                        By manipulating the flow of Qi on a given meridian, stagnant Qi can be dispersed and deficient Qi can be tonified. As a result, the symptoms that correspond to these underlying energetic imbalances should naturally improve. There
                        are 365 acupoints on the 12 meridians, along with numerous ‘extra points’ that are located throughout the body. There are also microsystems such as the ear, eye, nose, and hand. Some acupuncturists will only use these specific
                        areas regardless of the nature of the patient’s complaints. From a Western biomedical perspective, acupuncture has been proven to release the neurotransmitter serotonin and beta-endorphins, opiate-like substances made by the brain.
                        Serotonin balance is essential for emotional and mental health and has been linked to healthy eating patterns, sleeping patterns, and the degree of pain in the body. Beta-endorphins are analgesic and anti-inflammatory and are responsible
                        for the ‘runner’s high’, which is why acupuncture can induce similar sensations.</p>

                    <p>Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy which consists of burning dried mugwort on particular points on the body.</p>
                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">
                        It plays an important role in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. In traditional Chinese medicine, moxibustion is used on people who have a cold or stagnant condition. The burning of moxa is believed to expel
                        cold and warm the meridians, which leads to smoother flow of blood and qi. In Western medicine, moxibustion has successfully been used to turn breech babies into a normal head-down position prior to childbirth. A landmark study
                        published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998 found that up to 75% of women suffering from breech presentations before childbirth had fetuses that rotated to the normal position after receiving moxibustion
                        at an acupuncture point on the Bladder meridian. Other studies have shown that moxibustion increases the movement of the fetus in pregnant women, and may reduce the symptoms of menstrual cramps when used in conjunction with traditional
                        acupuncture.

                    <p>Cupping therapy is a specific type of alternative medicine that involves placing cups on the skin. </p>
                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">
                        Cupping is one of the oldest methods of traditional Chinese medicine. The cups that are used range in different types and function, some examples are glass cups, bamboo cups, silicone cups, and earthenware or clay cups. In a typical cupping session, glass
                        cups are warmed using a cotton ball or other flammable substance, which is soaked in alcohol, let, then placed inside the cup. Burning a substance inside the cup removes all the oxygen, which creates a vacuum. As the substance
                        burns, the cup is turned upside-down so that the practitioner can place the cup over a specific area. The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen anchors the cup to the skin and pulls it upward on the inside of the glass as the air
                        inside the jar cools. Drawing up the skin is believed to open up the skin’s pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of blood, balances and realigns the flow of qi, breaks up obstructions, and creates an avenue for toxins to be
                        drawn out of the body. Several cups may be placed on a patient’s body at the same time. Sometimes practitioners will also apply small amounts of medicated oils or herbal oils to the skin just before the cupping procedure, which
                        lets them move the cups up and down particular acupoints or meridians after they have been applied. In China, cupping is used primarily to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma, and congestion; arthritis; gastrointestinal
                        disorders; and certain types of pain. Some practitioners also use cupping to treat depression and reduce swelling. Fleshy sites on the body, such as the back and stomach (and, to a lesser extent, the arms and legs), are the preferred
                        sites for treatment.

                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Auriculotherapy is a health care modality whereby the external surface of the ear, or auricle, is stimulated to alleviate pathological conditions in other parts of the body. The discovery of this therapy is partially based on the ancient
                        Chinese practice of body acupuncture, yet it is also derived from the discoveries by a French physician in the 1950s. Dr. Paul Nogier and colleagues demonstrated that specific areas of the external ear were associated with pathology
                        in specific parts of the body.
                        <br></br>The Chinese practice applies auriculotherapy as one of the best known types of acupuncture; some acupuncture practitioners are known to master and reserve to apply treatments only through this type of method.
                        <br></br>The process and ideology of auriculotherapy includes the insertion of needles into ear acupoints to stimulate ear reflex points that are known to trigger desired energy movement in the other parts of the body as required
                        to treat the patient’s condition.
                        <br></br>Although the underlying mechanisms that might explain auricular acupuncture are not fully known, several different theories have been developed that provide a framework and structure to understand the clinical results
                        achieved with this treatment. Regardless of the skepticism of many who can’t understand the processes that enable this type of treatment, repeated clinical examples of patients through many centuries have been known to be benefitted
                        and healed from auricular acupuncture treatments.

                            <mark>Electroacupuncture <strong>should not</strong> be used on patients who have a
                                history of seizures, epilepsy, heart disease or strokes, or on patients with
                                pacemakers. It should also not be performed on a patient's head or throat, or
                                directly over the heart. Another recommendation is that when needles are being
                                connected to an electric current, the current should not travel across the midline
                                of the body (an imaginary line running from the bridge of the nose to the
                                bellybutton).</mark> <br></br>
                            Electroacupuncture is an acupuncture technique that, comparatively speaking, has only recently come into use: <br></br> Some scholars believe electroacupuncture was first used by physicians in France and Italy as far back as
                            the early 1800s. Others attribute its discovery to Japanese scientists in the 1940s who were interested in making bone fractures heal more quickly. Still others claim that electroacupuncture wasn't really developed until 1958,
                            when acupuncturists in China began experimenting with it as a form of pain relief. <br></br>
                            Electroacupuncture is quite similar to traditional acupuncture in that the same points are stimulated during treatment. As with traditional acupuncture, needles are inserted on specific points along the body. The needles are then attached to a device
                            that generates continuous electric pulses using small clips. These devices are used to adjust the frequency and intensity of the impulse being delivered, depending on the condition being treated. Electroacupuncture uses two
                            needles at time so that the impulses can pass from one needle to the other. Several pairs of needles can be stimulated simultaneously, usually for no more than 30 minutes at a time. <br></br>
                            One interesting advantage of electroacupuncture is that a practitioner does not have to be as precise with the insertion of needles. This is because the current delivered through the needle stimulates a larger area than the needle itself. <br></br>
                            Another major advantage is that electroacupuncture can be employed without using needles at all as well . A similar technique called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, uses electrodes that are taped to the surface of the skin instead
                            of being inserted. The advantage of this procedure is that it can be used by people who have a fear of needles or a condition that prohibits them from being needled.

                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Acupuncture is an ancient form of healthcare that originated in China at least 2,500 years ago. It has been practiced throughout the Asian world for many centuries. Acupuncture has been accepted into the Western mainstream culture
                        since the 1970’s and is currently soaring in popularity throughout many parts of the Western hemisphere. Through the use of extremely fine needles, acupuncture works by manipulating the flow of Qi in the body, which is the life
                        force or energy force that is present in all living things. Acupuncture theory suggests that there are 12 main meridians through which Qi flows. These meridians correspond to the major internal organs of the body. For instance,
                        there is a liver meridian, a heart meridian, and so on. In each of these meridians, the Qi can become stagnant or deficient. StagnantQi means that there is a blockage or excess of energy, which can cause a variety of symptoms including
                        pain, inflammation, headaches, high blood pressure, depression, and menstrual imbalances. Deficient Qi means that there isn’t enough functional energy within a given organ to perform its necessary duties. For instance, chronic
                        diarrhea and fatigue can easily be caused by deficient Qi of the spleen. Acupuncture therapy typically involves inserting needles into several acupoints, which are specific locations on the meridians where Qi is said to gather.
                        By manipulating the flow of Qi on a given meridian, stagnant Qi can be dispersed and deficient Qi can be tonified. As a result, the symptoms that correspond to these underlying energetic imbalances should naturally improve. There
                        are 365 acupoints on the 12 meridians, along with numerous ‘extra points’ that are located throughout the body. There are also microsystems such as the ear, eye, nose, and hand. Some acupuncturists will only use these specific
                        areas regardless of the nature of the patient’s complaints. From a Western biomedical perspective, acupuncture has been proven to release the neurotransmitter serotonin and beta-endorphins, opiate-like substances made by the brain.
                        Serotonin balance is essential for emotional and mental health and has been linked to healthy eating patterns, sleeping patterns, and the degree of pain in the body. Beta-endorphins are analgesic and anti-inflammatory and are responsible
                        for the ‘runner’s high’, which is why acupuncture can induce similar sensations.</p>

                    <p class="semi-headingdescriptions">Gua sha which translates to ‘scrape wind,’ involves using a tool with a smooth edge to stroke or scrape skin in one direction. This traditional technique remains popular as a quick and effective technique to release toxins and relieve
                        muscle tension and knots. By ‘scraping’ with repeated strokes on the surface of the skin, gua sha helps stimulate new blood flow and draw out stagnation in the problem areas to help generate metabolic cell repair and healing. <br></br>
                        The “sha” (wind) or purple streaks that can appear on the surface during the process is thought to represent the severity of the stagnation of blood flow in the area. The stroking/scraping motions of gua sha — generally not painful — can cause capillaries
                        near the skin surface to bleed, which causes the markings to surface. As strokes are applied, fluids and toxins are drawn to the skin. <br></br>

                        is the great regulator of biological systems and operates via electrical impulses that fire at the axon and bridge across the synaptic gap, which are then transformed to chemical signals. <br></br>
